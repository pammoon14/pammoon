# Project 2: Rendering 3D Map using Rayshader Package in R

## Description
This project is an extension of Project 1. Project 2 creates a 3D Map, visualizing the percentage of uninsured people in Texas by county, using data from the CDC's PLACES 500 Cities Project. The 3D visualization allows for an immersive and dynamic way to explore and understand population density data. 

### Highlighted Skills
**Power Query:** data cleaning, sorting, & filtering

**R:** left join using pipes, creating 2D and 3D maps, and rendering video

*(R Packages: dplyr, ggplot2, Rayshader, sf, rgl, rv, tidyverse)*   

## Data Source
**Texas data:** PLACES Local Data for Better Health, [County Data 2022 release](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-County-Data-20/swc5-untb)
